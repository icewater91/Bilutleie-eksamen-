This is a luxury car rental website (Oslo Bilutleie). The website offers multiples cars where clients have the oppertunities to rent luxury cars of their dreams. 

I choose this case because of my personal interest for luxury cars.
My inspiration list for this project is long. I was amazed by many websites on www.dribble.com and a little bit inspo from https://www.templatemonster.com/landings/saas-websites/car-rental-website-design/. I wanted and ended up with a clean and easy-looking website. 

THE PROJECT:
-- Interactive elements on the page
-- slideshows (pictures of cars)
-- Hamburger menu (for example: by clicking on ''contact'' in the hamburger menu, you will get to the contact section).
-- Hover effect on buttons
-- Functional buttons
